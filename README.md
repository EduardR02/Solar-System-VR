# Solar System

This is a VR port and modification of the original Solar System project by Sebastian Lague:  
https://github.com/SebLague/Solar-System  

## Goal
The goal of this project is to add an interaction and locomotion technique in VR, and also make this somewhat fun as a game.  
This is for a University project.  


## Planned Changes
- Add coins to collect
- Add interaction technique
- Fix shaders for Multi View rendering (!)
- New planets that look different
- Add nice Vignette
- Might add simple "walking" and rotation using controller joystick
## Made Changes
- Faster paced planet configuration
- More planets
- Auto rotate planets into camera view
- Got LOD calculation and origin shift working
- Main "player" object is now "Ship", PlayerController removed/not relevant
- Semi working projected player path line
- VR cam with interactors
- Particles as "booster exhaust"
